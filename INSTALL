Class::AutoDB

*** ALPHA SOFTWARE ***
These classes are still in their alpha state. Use is encouraged, and bug reporting is strongly encouraged :)
Although there are a hefty amount of unit and integration tests that stand behind these classes, there use in 
real-world scenarios has been limited, so don't do anything all mission-critical-like.

DESCRIPTION
Class::AutoDB => creates registries in the database (currently, only mysql is supported) and transparently stores 
and updates collections in those registries.

INSTALLATION

#IMPORTANT: 
# mysql must be installed and configured before Class::AutoDB is installed.
# Most of the tests will fail unless you have default write access to the database (mysql -u root),
# or unless you alter the connection parameters in t/DBConnector.pm.
# Also, Class::AutoClass needs to be installed first (tests are depending on it, don't let them down!)

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

CAVEOTS
- AutoDB saves lists by value, meaning that when a common list is referred to by multiple objects, a "snapshot" of
  that list (the list as it existed when the object when out of scope) will be taken. This is in contrast to when a 
  common object is referred to (by reference, not value) - only one version of the object will be persisted. See
  t/commonObjectTest.t for an example of this.

TODO
- AutoDB needs to handle hash,list as references

Class-AutoDB

This class works closely with Class::AutoClass to provide almost
transparent object persistence.  You can declare any class to be
persistent and can easily store any objects of a persistent class.
You can retrieve a stored object explicitly through a query
mechansism, or implicitly by following a reference pointing to the
object.  The persistence mechanism preserves the structure of the
object network: if objects A and B pointed to C when they were stored,
the retrieval process will reconstruct this relationship.

This class presently works only with MySQL.  

CAUTION: This module is old. We use it internally, and while it works
well for our purposes, we urge new users to heed the warnings in the
documentation.  This release brings the CPAN version of the module
up-to-date relative to our internal version, something we should have
done long ago.  

We are resuming active development of the code and expect to release
improved versions over the next several months.  See the "Roadmap"
section in the main documentation.

The 't' directory includes separate 'user' and 'developer' test
suites.  The installation procedure below runs the user test suite.
See t/README for more information.

The 'docs' directory contains additional documentation.  All of this
is presently for internal classes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

The module includes a modified version of Data::Dumper, renamed
Class::AutoDB::Dumper.  We include both the pure Perl and much faster
C (.xs) implementations. You need a C compiler to compile the C
implementation. We get a few compiler warnings when compiling
Dumper.xs. These seem benign and can be ignored. The Data::Dumper docs
claim that the code will fall back to the pure Perl implementation if
the C version is not available.  We haven't checked this claim.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.

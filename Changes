        - major refactor of persistence handling. store() method added to store objects explicitly (implicit 
          storage still occurs when an object is destroyed. Implicitly destroyed objects will not overwrite 
          explicitly destroyed ones). Mosts tests have been re-written and new ones have been added to test
          this storage handling.

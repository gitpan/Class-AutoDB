Class-AutoDB/t/README

The 't' directory includes separate 'user' and 'developer' test
suites.  

The user tests are in the top level 't' directory, ie, this
one. 'Build test' runs these tests.  These tests require read-write
access to a MySQL database and the ability to create an SDBM file in
the test directories. Build.PL checks these requirements and does not
create the Build script unless they are met. CPAN testing reports such
cases as "status UNKNOWN".

The developer tests are in the 'Developer' subdirectory tree.  There
are tests for each major component in separate trees under
'Developer'.

Most tests (in both suites) consist of multiple scripts that must be
run in sequence. Typically the first script creates the AutoDB
database and stores some data, and the next script retrieves the data.
Further subtests might modify the data and store it back, and then
retrieve the modified data.  We run these steps as separate programs
to make sure the data is really persistent.

We implement these compound tests by a (typically very simple) top
level script that runs the subtests, and put the subtests themelves in
a subdirectory with the same name (minus the '.t' suffix).  The user
tests and newly written developer tests follow this pattern; we are
slowly migrating old developer tests over.

** functionality **
put.pl and get.pl are tests (not part of the automated test harness) which outline the most basic functionality 
of Class::AutoDB. Get to know those tests first, then roam about the rest of the tests to get a better understanding
of the internals of Class::AutoDB.

Test that begin with a class name are unit tests for that class (for instance, RegistryTest.t tests Class::AutoDB::Registry).
Not all classes have tests (though most do), since higher-level tests often exhuastively test the functionality of certain
classes. Test that begin with the word "test" (note lower casing) are black-box functionality tests.


** Database connection problesm **

A file named "__noDBConnection" will be installed in the test directory (this directory) 
if no database connection can be made. The file should be cleaned up automatically 
(removed after tests are completed), but may not be removed if a test fails badly.

If you see messaging that no database connection can be made or DBI connect() failed, look 
for and remove the __noDBConnection file and try again.

** Implicit and explicit persistence tests **

Some tests in the test suite are broken into a + b components (for instances, testStorageStates4a.t and testStorageStates4b.t).
This is for testing implicitly stored objects, which are defined as objects that are persisted at global destruction time. 
Objects which are stored by calling the store() method on them are termed "explicitly" stored.

Implicit persistence occurs when the reference count of an object goes to zero (when there are no more pointers to that
object's memory space). This is why the test is broken into two seperate pieces. Part a sets up the object, part b tests the
persisted states. Actual persistence occurs between the two tests.

I have had no problems with race conditions on any of the systems which I use for testing. But given a sufficiently fast 
machine testing against a sufficiently busy database, it is possible for these tests to fail. If you experience this, try 
including:

sleep 5;

at the end of the "a" test.

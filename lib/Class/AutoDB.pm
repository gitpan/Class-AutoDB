=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class works closely with L<Class::AutoClass> to provide almost
transparent object persistence that can coexist with a
human-engineered database. The auto-persistence mechanism provides
hooks for connecting the two parts of the database together.

B<Caveat>: The current version only works with MySQL.

For applications where performance is not pressing, you can use this
class for all your persistent data.  In other cases, you can use it
for structurally complex, but low volume, parts of your database,
while storing performance-critical data in carefully engineered
tables.  This class is also handy for prototyping persistent
applications and lets you incrementally replace auto-persistent
components with engineered tables as your design proceeds.

=head2 Persistence model

This section presents a brief overview of the class.  Please see later
sections for details.

You declare a class to be persistent by defining the %AUTODB variable
in the module.  L<Class::AutoClass> (specifically,
Class::AutoClass::declare) uses %AUTODB to set everything up.

In simple cases, you set %AUTODB to 1, eg,

  %AUTODB=1;

This causes your class to be persistent, but provides no way to search
for objects and no convenient hook for connecting these objects to the
engineered parts of your database (unless a superclass provides these
capabilities).

More typically, you set %AUTODB to a hash of the form

  %AUTODB=(
    collection=>'Person', 
    keys=>qq(name string, sex string, id number));

This associates a persistent collection, called 'Person', with your
class and says that the Person collection has three search keys:
'name', 'sex', and 'id'.  Collections provide a way to search for
objects and are the hooks for connecting auto-persistent objects with
the rest of your database.

After setting up your classes to use Class::AutoDB, you use it as follows.

First you connect your program to the database by running
Class::AutoDB's 'new' method.  Then you typically invoke 'get' or
'find' to retrieve some number of "top level" objects.  Then, you
operate on objects as usual. If you touch an object that has not yet
been retrieved from the database, the system will automatically fetch
it for you.

The retrieval process reconstructs the original object network.  You
never get duplicate copies of a persistent object no matter how many
times you retrieve the object and no matter what path you use to reach
it.  In our running example, it doesn't matter whether you get all
Person objects first and then traverse their friends lists, or get
Person objects one-by-one and and traverse their friends lists as you
go.  The end result is the same: you end up with one copy of each
Person object, and the various friends lists point to these objects as
expected.

You can store specific objects in the database by invoking the 'put'
method on the object (deprecated) or on AutoDB (preferred). You can
store all objects using the 'put_objects' method on AutoDB.

  $joe->put;               # store one object (deprecated form)
  $autodb->put($joe);      # store one object (preferred form)
  $autodb->put_objects;    # store all objects

'put' stores the object and any Perl structures (typically ARRAYs or
HASHes) to which the object points B<except for other persistent
objects>.  The storage process converts references to persistent
objects into a representation (called an 'oid' -- stands for 'object
identifier') that the retrieval process can use later to fetch the
object on demand.

Thus, when 'putting' the 'Joe' object, the software stores Joe's
'name', 'sex', and 'id' (which are simple strings and numbers), and an
ARRAY of oids representing Joe's friends.  Your program is responsible
for making sure each friend object is also stored.

The difference between persistent and non-persistent objects is that
the system treats each persistent object as an independent unit but
considers non-persistent objects to be part of the persistent objects
that point to them.  If two persistent objects point to the same
non-persistent object, the system will store separate copies of the
non-persistent object when you 'put' the persistent ones, and will
retrieve separate copies of the non-persistent object when you
retrieve the persistent ones.  This is usually an error but may be
useful in special circumstances.

Suppose we extend our running example by adding a Name class to
represent the 'name' attribute of Person objects.  If you expect each
Person to have a separate Name object (which seems likely), it will
work fine for Name to be non-persistent.  However, if you want Persons
to share Names, you should declare Name to be persistent.

As of version 1.20, it is possible to delete persistent objects using
the 'del' method. Deleting an object removes it from memory and the
database. However, it does not remove references to the deleted
objects that may be held in program variable or other objects.  In
boolean context, a deleted object evaluates to undef; in a string
context it evaluates to an empty string. 

=head2 Defining a persistent class

You declare a class to be persistent by defining the %AUTODB variable
in the module.  Class:::AutoDB works closely with L<Class::AutoClass>
and in typical usage, Class::AutoClass::declare uses %AUTODB to set
everything up.

There is no way to arrange for some instances of a class to be
persistent while others are not.  Also, there is no way at present for
a subclass to be nonpersistent if any of its superclasses are
persistent.

%AUTODB specifies two properties of the persistent class (both optional).

=over 2

=item 1. Collections

Collections provide a way to search for objects and are the hooks for
connecting auto-persistent objects with the rest of your database.
You can define any number of collections for your class (including
none), and each collection can have any number of search keys (again
including none).

A collection can contain objects from many different classes. (This is
Perl after all -- what else would you expect ??!!) 

=item 2. Transients

Transients are keys of your object that you do not want Class::AutoDB
to store in the database when you 'put' the object.  These may be
values that are computed as needed and kept in the object for
convenience, or items tied to the program's execution (eg, an open
filehandle).  Needless to say, transient keys are not resurrected when
objects are retrieved.

=back

=head3 Collections

Collections contain references to objects (specifically oids), not
objects themselves.  This is why it works to have multiple collections
per class, and multiple classes per collection.

Search keys are typed: valid types are string, integer, float, object,
or the phrase list(<data type>), eg, list(integer). It also works to
use abbreviations for the types; any prefix is fine.  These are
translated into MySQL types as follows:

=over 2

=item * string -> longtext

=item * integer -> int

=item * float -> double

=item * object ->  bigint (unsigned)

=back

The types 'object' and 'list(object)' only work on objects whose
persistence is managed by Class::AutoDB.

For each collection, the system creates a relational table with an
'oid' column to connect the collection to the object being described,
and additional columns for the search keys.  List-valued search keys
are stored in separate link tables.  For our running example, the
system would create the following table:

 Person(oid bigint, name longtext, sex longtext, id int)

If multiple classes use the same collection, it is okay (even
sensible!) for one class to define the search keys, while the other
classes just refer to the collection by name. If multiple classes
define search keys for the collection, the definitions are 'added':
the search keys for the collection are the union of all the
definitions.  It is an error for multiple classes to give different
types to the same search key.

A similar situation arises in class hierarchies.  A subclass inherits
the collections used by its superclasses.  The subclass need not
define %AUTODB, but if it does, its values are 'added' to those of its
superclasses: the system associates the class with the union of the
collections specified by the class and its superclasses; if the
subclass defines additional search keys for some of these collections,
the systems adds these to the search keys defined in the
superclasses. It is an error for a subclass to define the type of a
search key differently than its superclasses.

It is also possible to L<programmatically define collections|"Defining
collections programmatically">, using the 'register' method of AutoDB.

=head3 Forms of %AUTODB 

There are several valid forms for %AUTODB.

=over 2

=item * unset

If you leave %AUTODB unset, the class inherits the persistence
properties of its superclasses.  If all superclasses are
nonpersistent, the class is also nonpersistent.

=item * single false value, eg, %AUTODB=0, or %AUTODB=undef

This is presently illegal. We reserve this form to specify that a
class be nonpersistent even if its superclasses are persistent.

=item * %AUTODB=1

This declares the class to be persistent but defines no collections or
transients. The class uses the collections and transients defined by
its superclasses, if any.  Note that setting %AUTODB to 1 really sets
it to the hash (1=>undef).

=back

The remaining forms set %AUTODB to a hash whose elements specify the
class's collections or transients. 

There are several forms for specifying collections.

=over 2

=item * standard single collection form

The hash has elements 'collection' and 'keys'.  For example 

  %AUTODB=(
    collection=>'Person', 
    keys=>qq(name string, sex string, id integer));

The meaning is obvious: 'collection' gives the name of the collection,
and 'keys' its search keys. 

You can specify 'keys' as a comma-separated string of "key type"
pairs, a HASH of key=>type pairs, or an ARRAY of keys.  In the first
two cases, the type is optional; in all cases, type defaults to
'string'.  Here are some examples.

  keys=>qq(name string, sex string, id integer)
  keys=>'name, sex, id integer'
  keys=>{name=>'string', sex=>'string', id=>'integer'}
  keys=>{name=>'', sex=>'', id=>'integer'}
  keys=>[qw(name sex id)]

=back

The remaining forms can specify any number of collections (including
none or one).  

The examples that follow extend our running example with a second
collection, 'HasName', which contains objects of many classes which
have 'name' attributes.

=over 2

=item * HASH of collections form

The hash has a 'collections' element ('collection' also works) and
does not have a 'keys' element. The 'collections' element is a HASH of
collection-name=>keys pairs.  As above, you can specify the keys as
strings of "key type" pairs, HASHes of key=>type pairs, ARRAYs of
keys, or a single key.

  %AUTODB=(
    collections=>{Person=>{name=>'string', sex=>'string', id=>'integer'},
		  HasName=>'name'});

=item * list of collections form

The hash has a 'collections' element ('collection' also works) and may
have a 'keys' element. The 'keys' element, if present, applies to all
collections.  This can make sense if a base class is defining core
properties of several collections with the expectation that subclasses
will refine the collections with additional keys.

The 'collections' element can be a whitespace- or comma-separated
string of collection names or an ARRAY of collection names.

  %AUTODB=(collections=>'Person HasName');
  %AUTODB=(collections=>[qw(Person HasName)]);

This form is best used when the collections are defined elsewhere.

=back

Transients are specified by a hash elements whose key is
'transients'. In the following examples, imagine that Person objects
have keys 'name_prefix' and 'sex_word'; the former might contain
honorifics like 'Dr' extracted from the name; the latter might be full
word sex descriptors computed from the single letter codes, eg
'female'.

You can specify transients keys as a whitespace- or comma-separated
string of keys, or an ARRAY of keys.

  transients=>qq(name_prefix sex_word)
  transients=>[qw(name_prefix sex_word)]

Putting it together, here are two examples of typical usage.

   %AUTODB=(
    collection=>'Person', 
    keys=>qq(name string, sex string, id integer),
    transients=>qq(name_prefix sex_word));

  %AUTODB=(
    collections=>{Person=>qq(name string, sex string, id integer),
                  HasName=>'name'},
    transients=>[qw(name_prefix sex_word)]);

=head3 Type mismatches

If you store data of the wrong type into a search key, Perl-ish data
conversion occurs.  (It might be better for the software to throw an
error).

=over 2

=item * a non-numeric value stored in a numeric key is converted to 0;
this includes references

=item * a reference stored in a string key is stringified, yielding
something like HASH(0x18a41e0); this is probably not what you had in
mind

=item * any non-persistent value stored in an object key is converted to NULL

=back

=head3 Defining collections programmatically

It is also possible to programmatically define collections using the
'register' method of AutoDB.  Every valid form of %AUTODB also work as
the argument to 'register'. In addition, 'register' can take a 'class'
parameter which specifies a class to be associated with the
collections being defined.

'class' can be a whitespace- or comma-separated string of class names,
or an ARRAY of class names.  Here are two examples.

  $autodb->register(
    collections=>{Person=>qq(name string, sex string, id integer),
                  HasName=>'name'});
  $autodb->register(
    class=>'Person', collections=>'Person, HasName');

When you 'register' new collections or add search keys to existing
ones (as in the first example above), the system creates or alters
database tables as needed to implement your changes.  These effects
are persistent, of course.

When you 'register' new associations between classes and collections
(as in the second example above), these changes are in effect for the
current session only. This makes it possible to dynamically change the
collections into which new objects are put.

=head2 Creating and initializing the database

Before you can use Class::AutoDB, you have to create a MySQL database
that will hold your data. We do not provide a means to do this here,
since you may want to put your AutoDB data in a database that holds
other data as well. The database can be empty or not. AutoDB creates
all the tables it needs -- you need not (and should not) create these
yourself.

B<Important note>: Hereafter, the term 'database' refers to the tables
created by AutoDB. Phrases like 'create the database' or 'initialize
the database' refer to these tables only, and not the entire MySQL
database that contains the AutoDB database.

We provide methods to create or drop the entire database (meaning, of
course, the AutoDB database, not the MySQL database) or to create
individual collections.

Class::AutoDB maintains a registry that describes the collections
stored in the database. The software registers collections as it
encounters class definitions . The system consults the registry when
running queries, when writing objects to the database, and when
modifying the database schema.

When 'new' connects to the database, it reads the registry saved from
the last time Class::AutoDB ran. It merges this with an in-memory
registry that generally reflects the currently loaded classes. 'new'
merges the registries, and stores the result for next time if the new
registry is different from the old.

B<Caveat>: You can only have one active AutoDB object at a time.
Grievous errors will occur if you run 'new' a second time on a
different database.  Sorry.  We will fix this.

=head2 Current design

B<Caveat>: The present implementation assumes MySQL. It is unclear how
deeply this assumption affects the design.

Every object is stored as a BLOB constructed by a L<slightly modified
version of Data::Dumper|"Data::Dumper details">. The database contains
a single 'object table' for the entire database whose schema is

 create table _AutoDB (
   oid bigint unsigned not null,
   primary key (oid),
   object longblob
   );

The oid is a unique object identifier assigned by the system. An oid is
a permanent, immutable identifier for the object.

For each collection, there is one table we call the base table that
holds scalar search keys, and one table per list-valued search key.
The name of the base table is the same as the name of the collection;
there is no way to change this at present. For our Person example, the
base table would be

 create table Person (
   oid bigint unsigned not null,     --- foreign key pointing to _AutoDB
   primary key (oid),                --- also primary key here
   name longtext,
   sex longtext,
   id int
   );

If a Person has a significant_other key (also a Person), the table would
look like this:

 create table Person (
   oid bigint unsigned not null,     --- foreign key pointing to _AutoDB
   primary key (oid),                --- also primary key here
   name longtext,
   sex longtext,
   id int,
   significant_other bigint unsigned --- foreign key pointing to _AutoDB
   );

The data types specified in the 'keys' parameter are used to define the
data types of these columns. They are also used to ensure correct
quoting of values bound into SQL queries. It is safe to use 'string' as
the data type even if the data is numeric unless you intend to run
'raw' SQL queries against the database and want to do numeric
comparisons.

For each list valued search key, we need another table which (no
surprise) is a classic link table. The name is constructed by
concatenating the collection name and key name, with a '_' in between.

If 'friends' were a search key in the Person collection. the link
table would be

 create table Person_friends (
   oid bigint unsigned not null,  --- foreign key pointing to _AutoDB
   friends bigint unsigned        --- foreign key pointing to _AutoDB
                                  --- (will be a Person)
   );

A small detail: since the whole purpose of these tables is to enable
querying, indexes are created for each column by default (indexes can
be turned off by specifying index=>0 to the AutoDB constructor).

When the system stores an object, it converts any object references
contained therein into the oids for those objects. In other words,
objects in the database refer to each other using oids rather than the
in-memory object references used by Perl. There is no loss of
information since an oid is a permanent, immutable identifier for the
object.

When an object is retrieved from the database, the system does NOT
immediately process the oids it contains. Instead, the system waits
until the program tries to access the referenced object at which point
it automatically retrieves the object from the database. In a future
release, options may be provided to retrieve oids earlier.

If a program retrieves the same oid multiple times, the system short
circuits the database access and ensures that only one copy of the
object exists in memory at any point in time. If this weren't the case,
a program could end up with two objects representing Joe, and an update
to one would not be visible in the other. If both copies were later
stored, one update would be lost. The core of the solution is to
maintain an in-memory hash of all fetched objects (keyed by oid). The
software consults this hash when asked to retrieve an object; if the
object is already in memory, it is returned without even going to the
database.

Deleting an object converts its in-memory representation to a special
kind of deleted-oid, removes the object from all its collections, and
changes its BLOB in the object column of the _AutoDB table to NULL. We
leave the object's oid in the _AutoDB table to allow better error
handling on subsequent attempts to access the object.  See L<"Object
deletion details"> for further discussion.

=head3 Data::Dumper details

We rely on "freezer" and "toaster" methods to convert references to
persistent objects into oids when objects are stored, and convert oids
back to references when objects are fetched.  The native support for
"freezer" and "toaster" methods in L<Data::Dumper> (as of version
2.125) falls short of our needs in two respects:

=over 2

=item 1. Data::Dumper requires that the "freezer" method modify the
object being dumped, rather than letting the method return a modified
copy of the object.

=item 2. If any class has a "toaster" method, Data::Dumper assumes all
classes do and emits a call to the method even if the object in
question can't do it.

=back

We modified Data::Dumper to fix these problems. To avoid any confusion
with the official version of the code, we renamed the modified version
Class::AutoDB::Dumper and include it in our code tree.

Data::Dumper provides both pure Perl and much faster C (.xs)
implementations.  We modified both implementations.

B<Caveat>: The build process automatically compiles the C
implementation I<if your system has a C compiler>. We see a few
compiler warnings in this process. These seem benign and can be
ignored. The Data::Dumper docs claim that the code will fall back to
the pure Perl implementation if the C version is not available.  We
haven't checked this claim.

=head3 Object deletion details

Object deletion is a bit messy, since it is not a Perl concept.  In
standard Perl, an object exists until all references to the object
cease to exist.  As a result, the programmer never has to worry about
stale references.  The situation changes when we introduce object
deletion: it is now possible for a variable to contain a reference
pointing to an object that has been deleted; likewise, an object can
contain a reference (technically an Oid) pointing to a deleted object.

The closest Perl analog is L<weak
references|Scalar::Util/"weaken_REF">.  The standard Perl rule stated
above -- "an object exists until all references to the object cease to
exist" -- does not apply to weak references.  A weak reference can go
stale (in other words, point to an object that no longer exists). When
this happens, Perl sets the reference to undef, and any attempt to
access the object via the stale reference generates an error.

We adopt similar semantics for object deletion.  We do not convert
stale references to undef (would require delving into Perl internals
-- doable but not worth the effort), but we detect attempts to invoke
methods on deleted objects and 'confess' with appropriate error
messages.  This complicates the application, but there seems to be no
better choice.

An application that uses object deletion extensively has to guard
against attempts to invoke methods on deleted objects.  One way to
do this is to test the object before accessing it.  For example, if
$object contains a reference to an object that might be deleted,
you might use this code snippet:

 if ($object) {   # $object will test 'true' if it still exists
   # okay to invoke methods on $object here
 } else {           # 'else' $object has been deleted
   # deal with deleted object here
 }

To avoid such complications, we recommend using object deletion only
in situations where you can confidently remove all references to the
deleted objects.  For example, we use it when re-initializing entire
data structures.

The 'del' method operates on the in-memory and database
representations of the objects being deleted. 

It converts the in-memory representation to an OidDeleted, which is a
special kind of Oid.  Any attempt to invoke application methods on an
OidDeleted confesses.

On the database, 'del' updates the object table (_AutoDB) and all
tables implementing collections that contain the object.  In _AutoDB,
'del' sets the 'object' column to NULL thereby removing the object's
BLOB representation from the database; it leaves the object's oid in
_AutoDB so we can detect future attempts to access the deleted object
and generate an appropriate error message.  (If we were to delete the
oid, it would look like the object was never stored, and future
accesses would generate a misleading error message).  In collection
tables, 'del' removes all rows representing the object; the code
basically deletes the object from any table that 'put' would have put
it in.

'del' does B<not> remove references to the deleted object as this
would require scanning the entire database.

Queries ('get', 'find') will never retrieve a deleted object (although
they may retrieve objects containing references to deleted object),
and 'count' will not include deleted objects in its count.

           The connection parameters provided are ones we find useful in our 
           work. Many more are possible. If you need other parameters, you can 
           construct a DSN or open a DBH in your code and pass it in.

           Schema modification parameters
           Control schema changes carried out automatically by 'new'. Illegal to
           set more than one to true. When all left unspecified or undef, system

=head3 AutoDB attributes

You can access many parameters to 'new' using method notation.  Most
of these should be set only by 'new', but this is not
enforced. Attributes related to the database connection, eg,
'database', 'host', etc., are computed from the DBH or retrieved from
the database server if the DBH is set.

To get the value of attribute xxx, just say

  $xxx=$autodb->xxx;

To set an attribute, say

  $autodb->xxx($new_value);

The available attributes are

=over 2

=item * database Database name

=item * host     Database host (or server)

=item * server   Synonym for 'host'

=item * user     Database username

=item * password Database user's password

=item * pass     Synonym for 'password'

=item * dbd      Name of DBD driver. Must be 'mysql' at present
 
=item * dsn      DSN (data source) string in the format supported by DBD driver

=item * socket   MySQL socket. Usually not defined

=item * sock     Synonym for 'socket'

=item * port     Database server port. Usually not defined

=item * dbh      Connected database handle returned by DBI::connect

=item * timeout  MySQL inactive session timeout in seconds. The system default
                 (8 hours (28800 seconds) unless changed by your database admin)
                 is usually fine. The value returned is retrieved from the 
                 database server and can change out from under you. If the
                 server decides the timeout is too small, it resets it to the 
                 system default. 
 
=item * read_only_schema Single option to turn off 'create', 'alter', 'drop'
 
=back

Note that the 'create', 'alter', and 'drop' parameters cannot be
accessed in this way, because the methods that performed the indicated
actions have the same names.  Sorry.

=head3 renew

 Title   : renew
 Usage   : $autodb->renew(read_only_schema=>1)
 Function: Reinitialize $autodb object
 Returns : same Class::AutoDB object
 Args    : same as 'new'
 Notes   : Uses parameters set in 'new' unless changed by args

Reinitializes the AutoDB object, disconnects from the database, and
reconnects. This method is rarely needed; usually you want
L<reconnect> .

=head3 connect

 Title   : connect
 Usage   : $autodb->connect
           -- OR --
           $autodb->connect(database=>'test')
 Function: Connect to database. Does nothing if already connected
 Returns : database handle (DBH) if successful, else undef
 Args    : same as 'new'
 Notes   : Uses connections parameters set in 'new' unless changed by args

'new' calls this method to establish the database connection. Since,
at present, 'new' will fail if it is unable to make the connection,
there is little reason to call 'connect' later. You should use
L<reconnect> to change the connection.

=head3 disconnect

 Title   : disconnect
 Usage   : $autodb->disconnect
 Function: Disconnect from database
 Returns : undef
 Args    : none

Users rarely need to run this, because connections go away
automatically when your program ends.

=head3 reconnect

 Title   : reconnect
 Usage   : $autodb->reconnect
           -- OR --
           $autodb->reconnect(database=>'test')
 Function: Disconnect from database and then connect
 Returns : database handle (DBH) if successful, else undef
 Args    : same as 'new'
 Notes   : Uses connections parameters set in 'new' unless changed by args

This is the method to use if you want to change connection parameters,
such as the database or user. It's okay to use this even if you have
already done a 'disconnect'.

=head3 is_connected

 Title   : is_connected
 Usage   : $autodb->is_connected
 Function: Tell if there is a usuable database connection
 Returns : undef
 Args    : none

This really just sees if the DBH is set. Use L<ping> to test if the connection is live.

=head3 ping

 Title   : ping
 Usage   : $autodb->ping
 Function: Tell if the database connection is live
 Returns : undef
 Args    : none

We recommend using this as a last resort, because of potential
performance problems.  In most cases, L<is_connected> is adequate.
Actually, in most cases, you can just assume that there is a
connection, because 'new' will fail if it cannot establish the
connection, and the underlying DBI software will reconnect
automatically if the connection breaks.

=head2 Queries

 Function: Execute query and return results
 Returns : list or ARRAY of objects satisfying query
 Args    : collection Name of collection being queried
           query      search_key=>value pairs. Each search key must be defined
                      for collection. Each value must be single value of correct
                      type for search key. For all types except 'object' or 
                      'list(object)', value must be simple scalar (string or 
                      integer). For 'object' or 'list(object)', value must be
                      persistent object
           sql        raw SQL that selects oids of objects to be retrieved 
           other args interpreted as search_key=>value pairs
 Notes   : With no arguments, retrieves all objects.
           Okay to include both search keys and SQL

search_key=>value pairs are ANDed. For list types, the query is true if
any element on list has the value. If a collection has a search key named
'collection', you must use an explicit 'query' arg to include it in a query.

The SQL argument must select a single column which is interpreted as
containing the oids of objects to be retrieved. Our code adds
additional SQL that uses the oids to select objects from _AutoDB.

If you supply search_key=>value pairs and a SQL statement, they are ANDed.

=head3 find

 Usage   : my $cursor=$autodb->find(collection=>'Person',name=>'Joe',sex=>'M')

 Function: Retrieve next result for cursor or undef if there are no more
 Returns : object satisfying query or undef
 Args    : none
 Notes   : Allows simple while loops to iterate over results as in SYNOPSIS

=head3 count

 Title   : count
 Usage   : my $count=$cursor->count
 Function: Count number of objects satisfying query associated with cursor
 Returns : number
 Args    : none

=head3 reset

 Title   : reset
 Usage   : $cursor->reset
 Function: Re-execute query associated with cursor.
 Returns : nothing
 Args    : none
 Notes   : Subsequent 'get' or 'get_next' operation will start at beginning 

=head2 Updates

=head3 put

 Title   : put
 Usage   : $autodb->put(@objects)
 Function: Store one or more objects in database
 Returns : nothing
 Args    : list of persistent objects, Oids, or OidDeleteds
 Notes   : nop (does nothing) on Oids and OidDeleteds

The difference between 'put' and 'put_objects' is that when called
with no objects, 'put' does nothing, while 'put_objects' stores all
persistent objects

=head3 put_objects

 Title   : put_objects
 Usage   : $autodb->put_objects
           -- OR --
           $autodb->put_objects(@objects)
 Function: Store all persistent objects (first form) or list of persistent 
           objects (second form)
 Returns : nothing
 Args    : list of persistent objects, Oids, or OidDeleteds
 Notes   : nop (does nothing) on Oids and OidDeleteds

The difference between 'put' and 'put_objects' is that when called
with no objects, 'put' does nothing, while 'put_objects' stores all
persistent objects

=head3 del

 Title   : del
 Usage   : $autodb->del(@objects)
 Function: Delete one or more objects from memory and database
 Returns : nothing
 Args    : list of persistent objects, Oids, or OidDeleteds
 Notes   : nop (does nothing) on OidDeleteds

=head2 Manage database schema 

=head3 exists

 Title   : exists
 Usage   : my $bool=$autodb->exists
 Function: Test whether AutoDB database exists
 Returns : boolean
 Args    : none

=head3 register

 Title   : register
 Usage   : $autodb->register(class=>'Person',collection=>'Person', 
                             keys=>qq(name string, sex string, id integer),
                             transients=>qq(name_prefix sex_word))
 Function: Register collection with the system
 Returns : nothing
 Args    : class      whitespace- or comma-separated string of class names, or
                      ARRAY of class names (optional)
           other args any valid form of %AUTODB

When you 'register' new collections or add search keys to existing
ones, the system creates or alters database tables as needed to
implement your changes.  These effects are persistent, of course.

When you 'register' new associations between classes and collections,
these changes are in effect for the current session only. This makes
it possible to dynamically change the collections into which new
objects are put.

=head3 create

 Title   : create
 Usage   : $autodb->create
 Function: Create AutoDB database
 Returns : nothing useful
 Args    : none

The system drops the existing AutoDB database, if any, and then
creates the new one. Dropping the old database drops the _AutoDB table
and all tables used to implement the collections that exist in the
saved registry. Creating the new database creates the_AutoDB table and
all tables needed to implement the collections registered in the
current, in-memory registry.

The 'create' option to 'new' runs this method.

=head3 alter

 Title   : alter
 Usage   : $autodb->alter
 Function: Alter AutoDB database to reflect differences between current,
           in-memory registry and saved registry
 Returns : nothing useful
 Args    : none

The only alterations that are allowed are expansions. New collections
can be created and new search keys can be added to existing
collections. 

Users rarely need to use this method, because the system handles
alterations automatically.

=head3 drop

 Title   : drop
 Usage   : $autodb->drop
 Function: Drop AutoDB database
 Returns : nothing useful
 Args    : none

The system drops the existing AutoDB database, if any. This drops the
_AutoDB table and all tables used to implement the collections that
exist in the saved registry.

The 'drop' option to 'new' runs this method.

=head2 Persistent objects and Oids 

When you declare a class to be persistent, we arrange for it to
inherit from Class::AutoDB::Object by modifying its @ISA array. This
has the effect of polluting your class's namespace with inherited
methods.  It was a bad idea.  Sorry.  We hope to change this in a
future release.

Two of the inherited methods are commonly used. These can be invoked
on a persistent object or a Class::AutoDB::Oid object. It's usually
okay to override these methods.  Our code never calls them, so
overriding them won't break any Class:AutoDB mechanisms.

B<Caveat>: Class::AutoDB::Oid also defines these methods. If you
override these methods, your version will B<not> be invoked on a
Class::AutoDB::Oid object.  If this is a problem, you should make sure
your objects are thawed before invoking the methods.

=head3 put

 Title   : put
 Usage   : $object->put
 Function: Store object in database
 Returns : nothing
 Args    : none
 Notes   : Deprecated.  Should use $autodb->put($object)
           Legal to invoke on Oid or OidDeleted but does nothing

=head3 oid

 Title   : oid
 Usage   : my $oid=$object->oid
 Function: Access object's oid (immutable object identifier)
 Returns : oid as number, NOT Class::AutoDB::Oid object
 Args    : none
 Notes   : Deprecated.  Should use $autodb->oid($object)
           Also works on Oid or OidDeleted

=head1 SEE ALSO

We rely on L<DBI> and its MySQL driver, L<DBD::mysql>, for access to
the underlying database.  See L<DBI> for information on database
handles (DBHs) and L<DBD::mysql>, for the format of data source name
(DSN) strings.

This class works closely with L<Class::AutoClass> whose 'declare'
function sets up persistent classes using the value of %AUTODB.

Many CPAN modules provide capabilities similar to those provided
here. These include L<Alzabo>, L<Class::DBI>, L<DBIx::Class>,
L<DBIx::RecordSet>, L<DBM::Deep>, L<Fey::ORM>, L<KiokuDB>, L<OOPS>,
L<ORM>, L<Pixie>, L<SPOPS>, and L<Tangram>.

=head2 Known Bugs and Caveats

=over 2

=item 1. This module is old

We use it, and it works well for our purposes, but it's showing its age.

=item 2. The current version only works with MySQL

The first step of the installation process, 'perl Build.PL', makes
sure that MySQL is available and that the person doing the
installation has sufficient privileges to run the test suite. If this
check fails, Build.PL does not generate the Build script and exits
with a 0 return code. This is the idiom recommended for automated CPAN
testing but may be too severe for normal installs.

=item 3. One AutoDB at a time

You can only have one active AutoDB object at a time.  Grievous errors
will occur if you run 'new' a second time on a different database.

=item 4. No transactions

This is also on our to-do list, but further down, as we have no urgent
need for transactions in our application.

=item 5. Type mismatches

If data of the wrong type is stored in a search key, data conversion
occurs as described in L<Type mismatches>.

=item 6. Class attributes not stored or retrieved

Class attributes (as that term is used in L<Class::AutoClass>) are not
stored in the AutoDB database and are not set when objects are fetched
or classes 'used'. This is related to the simple way class attributes
are handled in Class::AutoClass.

=item 7. Uneven error checking

The software does not consistently check for user errors. If you make
a mistake and pass in bad data. the software sometimes responds with
an intelligible error message but often does not.  All too often, the
mistake winds its way into the guts of the software which ultimately
dies with an inscrutable message.
 
=item 8. Pollution of user class namespace

The current design requires that persistent classes be subclasses of
Class::AutoDB::Object; we ensure this by pushing the required class
onto @ISA if it's not already there.  This has the unfortunate side
effect of polluting the persistent classes' namespace with every
method in Class::AutoDB::Object and above.  This is only a problem
when user classes employ multiple inheritance.

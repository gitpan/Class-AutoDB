Class-AutoDB/docs/README

The 'docs' directory contains additional documentation.  All of this
is presently for internal classes.

Documentation of internal classes, in the form of '.pod' files, are in
the 'Developer' subdirectory tree.

Caveat: This documentation was not updated for version 1.10 and and
may be incorrect in places.  It is certainly incomplete.
